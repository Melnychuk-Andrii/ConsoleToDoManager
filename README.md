This is a simple todo manager written in c#. 
Not very fancy, just wanted to try c# as well as it's json Serialize and Deserialize functionality.

Functionality includes:
  - when opened displays all tasks for today
  - can view and add new todos and reminders
  - filters for viewing todos
  - sorting todos by priority
